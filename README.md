# Digital Clock With JS
This page displays the current time of the day and a background image which complements the time.

## Experience
- I figured out how to write cleaner if statements
- I learnt a new css property, `-webkit-box-reflect`
- I jogged my memory on APIs
- I learnt 2 new similar Javascript functions, `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` and how they differ

It was a fun project!
